Un système en boucle ouverte présente deux pôles instables (à parties réelles 
positives). On cherche à montrer que ce système peut être stable en 
modifiant la valeur du gain $K$ en boucle ouverte. La figure ci-dessous 
représente la réponse harmonique du système en boucle ouverte que l'on souhaite
asservir à l'aide d'une boucle de contre-réaction pour $K=1$.
