\exercice{Décomposition d'un signal}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\question{}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Le signal $e(t)$ est défini par :
\[
e(t)=\begin{cases}
    0&\quad t<0 \\
    t&\quad t\in[0,1]\\
    2-t&\quad t\in[1,3]\\
    t-4&\quad t\in[3,4]\\
    0&\quad t>4
     \end{cases}
\]
On peut alors décomposer $e(t)$ en somme d'échelon :
\[
    e(t)=t    \left(u(t)-u(t-1)  \right)+(2-t)\left(u(t-1)-u(t-3)\right)+
         (t-4)\left(u(t-3)-u(t-4)\right) 
\]
En regroupant les termes, on obtient alors :
\[
    e(t)=tu(t)+2(1-t)u(t-1)+2(t-3)u(t-3)-(t-4)u(t-4)
\]
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

La transformée de Laplace $E(p)$ est simplement donnée par la transformée de

                       +\dfrac{2e^{-3p}}{p^2}\left(1-3p\right)
                       -\dfrac{e^{-4p}}{p^2}\left(1-4p\right)
\]
ou encore
\[
    E(p)=\dfrac{1}{p^2}\left(1+2e^{-p}(p-1)+2e^{-3p}(1-3p)-e^{-4p}(1-4p)\right)

\`A l'aide des fonctions échelons le signal s'écrit alors 
\[
    e(t)=t^2\left(u(t)-u(t-1)\right)+(t-2)^2\left(u(t-1)-u(t-2)\right).
\]
En regroupant les termes on peut réecrire cette expression sous la forme :
\[
    e(t)=t^2u(t)-4(t-1)u(t-1)-t^2u(t-2)+4(t-1)u(t-2)

    E(p)=\dfrac{2}{p^3}-4e^{-p}\left(\dfrac{1}{p^2}-\dfrac{1}{p}\right)
        -e^{-2p}\dfrac{2}{p^3}+4e^{-2p}\left(\dfrac{1}{p^2}-\dfrac{1}{p}\right)

\[
    E(p)=\dfrac{2}{p^3}\left(1-e^{-2p}\right)
        -4\left(\dfrac{1}{p^2}-\dfrac{1}{p}\right)\left(e^{-p}-e^{-2p}\right)

On sollicite un système linéaire continu et invariant par deux signaux $e_1(t)$ 
et $e_2(t)$ (d'amplitude maximale et de durée unité) définits 
par les graphes ci-contre.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\question{}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Décomposons $e_1(t)$ et $e_2(t)$ par morceaux. On a alors :
\[
e_1(t)=
\begin{cases}

\begin{cases}
    0&\quad t<0\\
    t&\quad t\in[0,1]\\
    0&\quad t>1

On peut alors écrire ces signaux comme la somme des signaux usuels comme:
\[
    e_1(t)=(1-t)\left(u(t)-u(t-1)\right)=u(t)-r(t)-u(t-1)+r(t-1)
\]
et
\[
    e_2(t)=t\left(u(t)-u(t-1)\right)=r(t)-r(t-1)

où $u(t)$ est la fonction échelon et $r(t)$ la fonction rampe.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Les transformées sont simplement données par la propriété des fonctions

La fonction $\delta_a(t)$ est simplement donnée par 
\[
    \color{col1}p_a(t)
    =\color{col4}\dfrac{1}{a}u(t)\color{col3}-\dfrac{1}{a}u(t-a)
    =\normalcolor\dfrac{1}{a}\left(u(t)-u(t-a)\right)
\] 
où $u(t)$ est la fonction échelon unité.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\question{}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
On rappel la transformée de Laplace d'une fonction retardée :
\[
    \laplace{f(t-\tau)} = e^{-\tau p}F(p)
\]
La transformée de Laplace de $\delta_a(t)$ est donc donnée par : 
\[
    \Delta_a(p) = \laplace{\delta_a(t)}
                = \dfrac{1}{a}\left(\laplace{u(t)}-\laplace{u(t-a)}\right)
                = \dfrac{1}{ap}(1-e^{-ap})
\]
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\question{}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Le développement limité d'ordre 1 de $e^{x}=1+x+o\left(x\right)$ permet de
déterminer la limite pour $a\rightarrow0$ de la transformée de Laplace de 
$\delta_a(t)$. En effet, 
\[
    \lim_{a\to0} \Delta_a(p) = \dfrac{1}{ap}(1-1+ap)=1.
\]
Puisque la transformée de Laplace d'une impulsion de Dirac est égale à 1, on a
bien vérifié que $\lim_{a\to0} \delta_a(p)=\delta(t)$ où $\delta(t)$ est 
l'impulsion de Dirac.

\exercice{Décharge d'un condensateur}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Dans cet exercice nous allons appliquer la méthodologie générale pour la
résolution d'une équation différentielle à coefficients constants.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\question{}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
La transformée de Laplace de l'équation différentielle de la décharge d'un
condensateur est donnée par :
\[
    \tau(pQ(p)-q_0)+Q(p)=0
\]
où $q_0$ est la condition initialle de $q(t)$.
La résolution algébrique de cette équation nous donne 
\[
    Q(p)(\tau p+1)=q_0\tau
\]
ou encore :
\[
    Q(p)=q_0\dfrac{\tau}{\tau p+1}
\]
Remarquons que cette solution ne dépend que des conditions initiales, il n'est 
pas possible de définir une fonction de transfert dans ce cas particulier.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\question{}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Pour déterminer la solution $q(t)$ de l'équation différentielle, il suffit de 
déterminer la transformée inverse de $Q(p)$.

La transformée inverse de la fonction $F(p)=\dfrac{1}{p+a}$ est $f(t)=e^{-a}$.
Donc sous la forme,
\[
    Q(p)=q_0\dfrac{1}{p+\dfrac{1}{\tau}},
\]
la transformée inverse de $Q(p)$ est simplement donnée par 
\[
    q(t)=q_0e^{-\dfrac{t}{\tau}}
\]

\question{}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
La transformée de Laplace de l'équation différentielle nous donne : 
\[
    X(p)\left(mp^2+bp+k\right)=F(p)
\]
ainsi on peut écrire $X(p)$ sous la forme :
\[
    X(p)=\dfrac{1}{mp^2+bp+k}F(p)
\]
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\question{}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
On identifie simplement la fonction de transfert du système comme la fraction 
rationnelle définie par le rapport $\dfrac{X(p)}{F(p)}$
\[
    H(p)=\dfrac{1}{mp^2+bp+k}
\]

Sous forme canonique, cette fonction de transfert s'écrit :
\[
    H(p)=\dfrac{1}{k\left(\dfrac{m}{k}p^2+\dfrac{b}{k}p+1\right)}
\]
On sollicite le système par une impulsion de Dirac. Dans les faits, on peut 
voir cette sollicitation comme l'application d'une force $f(t)$ constante 
d'intensité $\dfrac{1}{a}$ intense pendant un temps $a$ très court 
(c.-à-d. $a\to0$).    
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\question{}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
La transformée de Laplace de cette sollicitation $F(p)$ est égale à 1 à 
la limite $a\to0$. On obtient alors pour la transformée de Laplace de la 
position :
\[
    X(p)=\dfrac{1}{mp^2+bp+k}

ou encore en utilisant la forme canonique de la fonction de transfert :
\[
    X(p)=\dfrac{1}{k\left(\dfrac{m}{k}p^2+\dfrac{b}{k}p+1\right)}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\question{}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Dans les conditions pour lesquels les paramètres $m, b ,k$ donne $\xi<1$ 
La solution est donc de la forme :
\[
    x(t)=K\dfrac{\omega}{\sqrt{1-\xi^2}}
         e^{-\xi\omega t}\sin{\omega\sqrt{1-\xi^2} t}

         e^{\frac{-b}{2m}t}\sin{\left(\dfrac{k}{m}-\dfrac{b^2}{4m^2}\right)^

\exercice{Forme canonique d'une fonction de transfert du premier ordre}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\question{}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
La transformée de Laplace de l'équation différentielle nous amène à définir
la fonction de transfert :
\[
    H(p)= \dfrac{S(p)}{E(p)}=\dfrac{b_0}{a_1p+a_0}
\]
sous forme canonique elle s'écrit :
\[
    H(p)=\dfrac{b_0}{a_0\left(\dfrac{a_1}{a_0}p+1\right)}
\]
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\question{}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Par identification, les paramètres $K$ et $\tau$ sont données par 
\[
    \begin{cases}
        K&=\dfrac{b_0}{a_0}\\[1.5em]
     \tau&=\dfrac{a_1}{a_0}
    \end{cases}
\]
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\question{}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
L'étude dimensionnelle de l'équation différentielle nous permet d'identifier
les relations suivantes :
\[
    [a_1][s(t)] T^{-1} = [a_0][s(t)] = [b_0][e(t)].
\]
Ainsi $\tau$ a toujours la dimension d'un temps quelque soit la dimension des 
signaux d'entrée  $e(t)$ et de sortie $s(t)$.
\[
    [\tau] = \dfrac{[a_1]}{[a_0]}= T.
\]
La dimension du paramètre $K$ dépend elle du rapport des dimensions de ces 
signaux. En effet,
\[
    [K]=\dfrac{[b_0]}{[a_0]}=\dfrac{[s(t)]}{[e(t)]}
\]
On peut dire que la dimension de la fonction de transfert est donnée par 
le paramètre $K$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
La forme factorisée de la fonction de transfert est alors donnée par 
\[
    H(p)=3\dfrac{(p-z_1)(p-z_2)}{(p-p_1)(p-p_2)(p-p_3)}
\]
ou encore en développant les différents termes,
\[
    H(p)=3\dfrac{(p+5+j)(p+5-j)}{(p+3)(p+1+2j)(p+1-2j)}
        %=3\dfrac{p^2+10p+26}{(p+3)(p^2+2p+5)}
        =3\dfrac{p^2+10p+26}{p^3+5p^2+11p+15}
\]
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\question{}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
La forme canonique de $H(p)$ est donnée par 
\[
    H(p)=\dfrac{26}{5}\dfrac{\frac{1}{26}p^2+\frac{10}{26}p+1}
                            {\frac{1}{15}p^3+\frac{1}{3}p^2+\frac{11}{15}p+1}
\]
On alors à faire à un système d'ordre 3 de classe 0 et de gain statique 
de valeur 5.2. 
Notons que dans le domaine de l'automatique les fractions sont communément
données sous forme décimales. On écrira donc plus facilement cette fonction
de transfert sous la forme :
\[
    H(p)=5.2\dfrac{0.0385p^2+0.385p+1}{0.066p^3+0.33p^2+0.733p+1}

Aussi sous cette forme, la question de la précision des valeurs décimales 
peut se poser.
