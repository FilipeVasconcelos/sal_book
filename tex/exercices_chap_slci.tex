(c.f \cref{para-decharge}). L'équation différentielle
de la charge $q(t)$ au borne du condensateur est donnée par :

Le condensateur est initialement chargé $q(0)=q_0$. On remarquera que le 
produit $RC$ est de dimension d'un temps. On notera cette constante $\tau=RC$.

On reprend ici, la mise en équation du système mécanique masse-ressort 
présentée dans ce chapitre (c.f \cref{para-masse_ressort}). L'équation 
différentielle reliant la position de la masse $z(t)$ et 
la force appliquée $f(t)$ est donnée par

constante de raideur du ressort. Ce système peut être considéré comme
un système dont l'entrée est la force $f(t)$ et la sortie est la position
$x(t)$ de la masse.
