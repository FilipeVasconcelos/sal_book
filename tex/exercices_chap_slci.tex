On reprend la mise en équation de la décharge d'un condensateur 
dans un circuit RC comme présentée dans ce chapitre 
(c.f \cref{para-decharge}). L'équation différentielle
de la charge $q(t)$ au borne du condensateur est donnée par :
\[
    RC\devi{q(t)}{}+q(t)=0
\]
Le condensateur est initialement chargé $q(0)=q_0$. On remarquera que le 
produit $RC$ est de dimension d'un temps. On notera cette constante $\tau=RC$.

\exercice{Système masse-ressort~\difficile}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

On reprend ici, la mise en équation du système mécanique masse-ressort 
présentée dans ce chapitre (c.f \cref{para-masse_ressort}). L'équation 
différentielle de la position de la masse est donnée par 
\[
m\devi{x(t)}{2}+b\devi{x(t)}{}+kx(t)=f(t)
\]
où $m$ est la masse, $b$ le coefficient d'amortissement visqueux et $k$ la
constante de raideur du ressort. Ce système peut être considéré comme
un système dont l'entrée est la force $f(t)$ et la sortie est la position
$x(t)$ de la masse.

\question{Déterminer la transformée de Laplace $X(p)$ solution algébrique 
de la transformée de Laplace de l'équation différentielle de ce système.}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
La transformée de Laplace de l'équation différentielle nous donnes : 
\[
    X(p)\left(mp^2+bp+k\right)=F(p)
\]
ainsi on peut écrire $X(p)$ sous la forme :
\[
    X(p)=\dfrac{1}{mp^2+bp+k}F(p)
\]

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\question{Indentifier la fonction de transfert $H(p)$ du système et 
donner sa forme canonique}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
On identifie simplement la fonction de transfert du système comme la fraction 
rationnelle définie par le rapport $\dfrac{X(p)}{F(p)}$
\[
    H(p)=\dfrac{1}{mp^2+bp+k}
\]

Sous forme canonique, cette fonction de transfert s'écrit :
\[
    H(p)=\dfrac{1}{k\left(\dfrac{m}{k}p^2+\dfrac{b}{k}p+1\right)}
\]


On sollicite le système par une impulsion de Dirac. Dans les faits, on peut 
voir cette sollicitation comme l'application d'une force $f(t)$ constante 
d'intensité $\dfrac{1}{a}$ intense pendant un temps $a$ très court 
(i.e $a\to0$).    
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\question{Indentifier la solution $x(t)$ pour une cette solicitation.}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
La transformée de Laplace de cette sollicitation $F(p)$ est égale à 1 à 
la limite $a\to0$. On obtient alors pour la transformée de Laplace de la position
\[
    X(p)=\dfrac{1}{mp^2+bp+k}
\]
ou encore sous la forme
\[
    X(p)=\dfrac{1}{k}\dfrac{\dfrac{k}{m}}{\left(p^2+\dfrac{b}{m}p+\dfrac{k}{m}\right)}
\]
Pour obtenir $x(t)$, la position dans le domaine temporelle, il faut 
appliquer la transformée de Laplace inverse. On identifie pour $X(p)$, 
la forme de la ligne 31 de la table des transformées de Laplace 
(c.f \cref{annexe-lap}).

\[
\laplacei{\dfrac{\omega^2}{p^2+2\xi\omega p+\omega^2}}=
    \dfrac{\omega}{\sqrt{1-\xi^2}}
    e^{-\xi\omega t}\sin{\omega\sqrt{1-\xi^2} t}
\]

Identifions les paramètres, $\xi$ et $\omega$ 
\[
    \omega^2=\dfrac{k}{m}
\]
\[
    2\xi\omega=\dfrac{b}{m}
\]
\[
    \xi=\dfrac{b}{2\sqrt{mk}}
\]
\[
    \xi^2=\dfrac{b^2}{4mk}
\]
\[
    1-\xi^2=1-\dfrac{b^2}{4mk}
\]
\[
    \sqrt{1-\xi^2}=\sqrt{1-\dfrac{b^2}{4mk}}
\]
\[
    \xi\omega=\dfrac{b}{2m}
\]
\[
    \sin{\omega\sqrt{1-\xi^2}t}=\sin{\sqrt{\left(\dfrac{k}{m}-\dfrac{b^2}{4m^2}\right)t}}
\]
\[
    \dfrac{\omega}{\sqrt{1-\xi^2}}=\dfrac{\sqrt{k}}{\sqrt{m-\dfrac{b^2}{4k}}}
\]
\[
    \dfrac{1}{k}\dfrac{\omega}{\sqrt{1-\xi^2}}=\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{mk-\dfrac{b^2}{4}}}
\]
Dans les conditions pour lequelle $\xi<1$ 
La solution est donc de la forme :
\[
    x(t)=\dfrac{1}{k}\dfrac{\omega}{\sqrt{1-\xi^2}}                                                                                                     e^{-\xi\omega t}\sin{\omega\sqrt{1-\xi^2} t} 
\]
ou encore 
\[
    x(t)=\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{mk-\dfrac{b^2}{4}}}e^{-\dfrac{b}{2m}t}\sin{\sqrt{\left(\dfrac{k}{m}-\dfrac{b^2}{4m^2}\right)t}}
\]
