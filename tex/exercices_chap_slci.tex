de la charge $q(t)$ au borne du condensateur est donnée par :
\[
    RC\devi{q(t)}{}+q(t)=0

Le condensateur est initialement chargé $q(0)=q_0$. On remarquera que le 
produit $RC$ est de dimension d'un temps. On notera cette constante $\tau=RC$.

constante de raideur du ressort. Ce système peut être considéré comme
un système dont l'entrée est la force $f(t)$ et la sortie est la position
$x(t)$ de la masse.
