\exercice{Décharge d'un condensateur}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
On reprend la mise en équation de la décharge d'un condensateur 
dans un circuit RC comme présentée dans ce chapitre. L'équation différentielle
de la charge $q(t)$ au borne du condensateur est donnée par :
\[
    RC\devi{q(t)}{}+q(t)=0
\]
Le condensateur est initialement chargé $q(0)=q_0$. On remarquera que le 
produit $RC$ est de dimension d'un temps. On notera cette constante $\tau=RC$.
