\section{Définitions de la précision}

Un système est précis si l'écart $\epsilon(t)$ entre l'entrée $e(t)$ et la sortie $s(t)$ 
de ce système est nul.
On distingue deux cas :
\begin{itemize}
    \item En régime permanent, cet écart $\epsilon(\infty)$ est nommée \textbf{erreur statique.}
    \item En régime transitoire, cet écart $\epsilon(t)=e(t)-s(t)$ est nommée \textbf{erreur dynamique.}
\end{itemize}
