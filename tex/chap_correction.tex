%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Nous avons établi et étudier en détail les différentes performances et 
exigences que l'on peut attendre de la réponse temporelle d'un système asservis.
Un système peut présenter des dépassements (c.f \Cref{chap-model}), être 
précis, rapide (c.f \Cref{chap-perf}), stable (c.f \Cref{chap-stab}). Ces
performances dépendent de essentiellement des propriétés de la fonction de 
transfert de la boucle fermée, elle même dépendant de la boucle ouverte.

Le correcteur dérivé sous cette forme est purement théorique, notamment parce
que le gain est infini lorsque la pulsation tend vers l'infini.

Une solution technologique permet de réaliser une forme approché :
\[
    C_{\text{D}}^{\text{réel}}(p)=\dfrac{\tau_d p}{1+\tau p}
\]
en choissisant un temps $\tau\ll\tau_d$, cette fonction de transfert se comporte
comme un correcteur dérivé idéal. On parle également dans ce cas de correcteur
\og D filtré\fg.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\begin{bequation}[ams align]
    C_{\text{AP}}(p)=k_p\dfrac{1+\alpha\tau p}{1+\tau p}

avec $\alpha>1$.

Le maximum de la phase se trouve à la moyenne géométrique du segment 
$\left[\dfrac{1}{\alpha\tau},\dfrac{1}{\alpha}\right]$ (l'echelle étant 
logarithmique ceux sont les rapports qui sont égaux)
\[
    \omega_m^2=\dfrac{1}{\alpha\tau^2}
\]
ou encore 
\[
    \omega_m=\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{\alpha}\tau}
\]
Pour $k_p=1$, $\alpha=5$ et $\tau=1$ on a alors 
$\omega_m=\SI{1}{\sqrt{5}}\sim\SI{0.44}{\radian\per\second}$.
\[
    \phi(\omega)=\arg{(C_{\text{AP}}(\jw))}
                =\arctan{\alpha\tau\omega_m}-\arctan{\tau\omega_m}
\]

\[
    \phi_m=\phi(\omega_m)=\arctan{\alpha\tau\omega_m}-\arctan{\tau\omega_m}
\]
en utilisant la relation trigonométrique pour $\tan{(a-b)}$ et en posant 
$a=\arctan{\alpha\tau\omega_m}$ et $b=\arctan{\tau\omega_m}$, on écrit:
\[
    \tan{\phi(\omega_m)}=\dfrac{\alpha\tau\omega_m-\tau\omega_m}
                               {1+\alpha\tau^2\omega_m^2}
                        =\dfrac{\alpha-1}{2\sqrt{\alpha}}
\]
donc on a :
\[
    \phi_m=\arctan{\left(\dfrac{\alpha-1}{2\sqrt{\alpha}}\right)}
\]
Une autre forme possible est également donnée par 
(en notant que $\sin\arctan{x}=\dfrac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}$):
\[
    \phi_m=\arcsin{\left(\dfrac{\alpha-1}{\alpha+1}\right)}
\]
On remarquera que le maximum ne dépend pas de $\tau$.
Pour $\alpha=5$, $\phi_m=\SI{41.8}{\degree}$.

Le gain pour la pulsation $\omega_m$ est donné par:
\[
    C_{\text{AP},\si{\dB}}(j\omega_m)=10\log{(1+\alpha^2\tau^2\omega_m^2)}-
                               10\log{(1+\tau^2\omega_m^2)}
\]
puisque $\tau^2\omega_m^2=\dfrac{1}{\alpha}$.
\[
    C_{\text{AP},\si{\dB}}(j\omega_m)=
    10\log{1+\alpha}-10\log{\dfrac{1+\alpha}{\alpha}}=10\log{\alpha}

On remarquera que le maximum ne dépend pas de $\tau$.
Pour $\beta=5$, $\phi_m=\SI{-41.8}{\degree}$.

Pour élaborer un correcteur Proportionnel Intégral Dérivé (PID), il suffit
evidemment de construire un correcteur avec les trois correcteurs 
élémentaires P, I et D comme brique de base. Il existe trois façon d'agencer
ces blocs de base pour élaborer un correcteur PID:

\begin{itemize}
    \item en \textbf{parallèle}
    \item en \textbf{série}
