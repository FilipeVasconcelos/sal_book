Le correcteur dérivé sous cette forme est purement théorique, notamment parce
que le gain est infini lorsque la pulsation tend vers l'infini.

Une solution technologique permet de réaliser une forme approché :
\[
    C_{\text{D}}^{\text{réel}}(p)=\dfrac{\tau_d p}{1+\tau p}
\]
en choissisant un temps $\tau\ll\tau_d$, cette fonction de transfert se comporte
comme un correcteur dérivé idéal.

Le correcteur à avance de phase (AP) est défini par la fonction de transfert :
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\begin{bequation}[ams align]
    C_{\text{AP}}(p)=k_p\dfrac{1+\alpha\tau p}{1+\tau p} 
\end{bequation}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
avec $\alpha>1$.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Le maximum de la phase se trouve à la moyenne géométrique du segment 
$\left[\dfrac{1}{\alpha\tau},\dfrac{1}{\alpha}\right]$ (l'echelle étant 
logarithmique ceux sont les rapports qui sont égaux)
\[
    \omega_m^2=\dfrac{1}{\alpha\tau^2}
\]
ou encore 
\[
    \omega_m=\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{\alpha}\tau}
\]
Pour $k_p=1$, $\alpha=5$ et $\tau=1$ on a alors 
$\omega_m=\SI{1}{\sqrt{5}}\sim\SI{0.44}{\radian\per\second}$.
\[
    \phi(\omega)=\arg{(C_{\text{AP}}(\jw))}
                =\arctan{\alpha\tau\omega_m}-\arctan{\tau\omega_m}
\]

\[
    \phi_m=\phi(\omega_m)=\arctan{\alpha\tau\omega_m}-\arctan{\tau\omega_m}
\]
en utilisant la relation trigonométrique pour $\tan{(a-b)}$ et en posant 
$a=\arctan{\alpha\tau\omega_m}$ et $b=\arctan{\tau\omega_m}$, on écrit:
\[
    \tan{\phi(\omega_m)}=\dfrac{\alpha\tau\omega_m-\tau\omega_m}
                               {1+\alpha\tau^2\omega_m^2}
                        =\dfrac{\alpha-1}{2\sqrt{\alpha}}
\]
donc on a :
\[
    \phi_m=\arctan{\left(\dfrac{\alpha-1}{2\sqrt{\alpha}}\right)}
\]
Une autre forme possible est également donnée par 
(en notant que $\sin\arctan{x}=\dfrac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}$):
\[
    \phi_m=\arcsin{\left(\dfrac{\alpha-1}{\alpha+1}\right)}
\]
On remarquera que le maximum ne dépend pas de $\tau$.
Pour $\alpha=5$, $\phi_m=\SI{41.8}{\degree}$.

Le gain pour la pulsation $\omega_m$ est donné par:
\[
    C_{\text{AP},\si{\dB}}(j\omega_m)=10\log{(1+\alpha^2\tau^2\omega_m^2)}-
                               10\log{(1+\tau^2\omega_m^2)}
\]
puisque $\tau^2\omega_m^2=\dfrac{1}{\alpha}$.
\[
    C_{\text{AP},\si{\dB}}(j\omega_m)=
    10\log{1+\alpha}-10\log{\dfrac{1+\alpha}{\alpha}}=10\log{\alpha}
\]

Le minimum de la phase se trouve à la moyenne géométrique du segment 
$\left[\dfrac{1}{\beta\tau},\dfrac{1}{\tau}\right]$. Cette pulsation 
est donnée par :
\[
    \omega_m=\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{\beta}\tau}

\]
en utilisant la relation trigonométrique pour $\tan{(a-b)}$ et 
en posant $a=\arctan{\tau\omega_m}$ et $b=\arctan{\beta\tau\omega_m}$, 
on écrit:
\[
    \tan{\phi(\omega_m)}=\dfrac{\tau\omega_m-\beta\tau\omega_m}

                        =\dfrac{1-\beta}{2\sqrt{\beta}}
\]
donc on a :
\[
    \phi_m=\arctan{\left(\dfrac{1-\beta}{2\sqrt{\beta}}\right)}
\]
On remarquera que le maximum ne dépend pas de $\tau$.
Pour $\beta=5$, $\phi_m=\SI{-41.8}{\degree}$.

Le gain pour la pulsation $\omega_m$ est donné par:
\[
    C_{\text{RP},\si{\dB}}(j\omega_m)=10\log{(1+\tau^2\omega_m^2)}-
                               10\log{(1+\beta^2\tau^2\omega_m^2)}
\]
puisque $\tau^2\omega_m^2=\dfrac{1}{\beta}$.
\[
    C_{\text{RP},\si{\dB}}(j\omega_m)=10\log{\left(\dfrac{1+\beta}{\beta}\right)}
                              -10\log{\left(1+\beta\right)}=-10\log{\beta}

\index{Correcteur ! Proportionnel Intégral Dérivé (PID)}
Pour élaborer un correcteur Proportionnel Intégral Dérivé (PID), il suffit
evidemment de construire un correcteur avec les trois correcteurs 
élémentaires P, I et D comme brique de base. Il existe trois façon d'agencer
ces blocs de base pour élaborer un correcteur PID:
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\begin{itemize}
    \item en \textbf{parallèle}
    \item en \textbf{série}
    \item et une combinaison des deux précédentes, dite \textbf{mixte}.
