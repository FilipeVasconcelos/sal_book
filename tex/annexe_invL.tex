\section{Contexte}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Il existe une forme analytique de la transformée inverse basée sur
la formule de Mellin-Fourier\cite{Ostertag}:
\[
s(t)=\laplacei{S(p)}=\int_{c-j\infty}^{c+j\infty} e^{pt}S(p)\dd{p}
\]
Cette inversion se fait donc par le biais d'une intégrale dans le plan
complexe. Cette intégrale n'ayant pas de forme analytique, il n'est possible 
d'approcher une solution qu'à l'aide d'outils numérique. 
Dans cette annnexe, nous discuterons deux implémentations en python de 
deux de ces algorithmes : 
l'algorithme de Gaver-Stehfest et l'algorithme fixe de Talbot comme présentés
par Abate et al.~\cite{abate2004,abate2006,frwiki:200676411}.
Avant de tester ces méthodes sur les systèmes linéaires, nous l'appliquerons
à l'inversion de Laplace :  
\[
    te^{-t}=\laplacei{\dfrac{1}{(p+1)^2}},
\]
dont on connait la forme analytique exacte.
Il faut noter que les méthodes et algorithmes présentés ici dépendent 
largement de la précision machine accessible pour le calcul en virgule flottante.
L'usage de librairie en précision arbitraire comme \texttt{mpmath} peut être 
nécessaire pour obtenir des résultats de meilleure précision. Il est également
connu que toutes les méthodes d'inversion numérique présente des problèmes
aux temps longs lorsque la fonction à inverser présente des pôles ce qui 
est très largement le cas des SLCI.

\section{Algorithme de Gaver-Stehfest}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
La transformée inverse par la méthode de Gaver-Stehfest est donné par 
(relation adaptée de l'équation (31) de~\cite{abate2006}) :
\[
f(t)=\dfrac{\ln{2}}{t}\sum_{k=1}^{2M}\zeta_kF\left(\dfrac{k\ln{2}}{t}\right)
\]
où l'on note $f(t)$ la fonction inverse de $F(p)$ et les $\zeta_k$ sont
donnés par la relation (32) de~\cite{abate2006} c'est à dire :
\[
\zeta_k = (-1)^{M+k} \sum_{j=\lfloor(k+1)/2\rfloor}^{\min{(k,M)}} 
\dfrac{j^{M+1}}{M!}\begin{pmatrix} M\\j  \end{pmatrix}
                   \begin{pmatrix} 2j\\j \end{pmatrix}
                   \begin{pmatrix} j\\k-j\end{pmatrix}
\]
avec $\lfloor x \rfloor$ le plus grand entier inférieur ou égal à $x$. Il 
nous faudra définir les coefficients binomiaux et les $\zeta_k$ avec les
deux fonctions suivantes :

La fonction \texttt{gaver\_stehfest} prend en paramètres 
le temps \texttt{t} et une fonction \texttt{f} représentant la fonction inverse 
$F(p)$.

\subsection*{Test de la méthode}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Soit la transformée de Laplace inverse connue :
\[
    te^{-t}=\laplacei{\dfrac{1}{(p+1)^2}}
\]
Nous cherchons à déterminer numériquement la transformée inverse 
pour différentes valeurs de $t\in[10^{-1},10^3]$  
\begin{minted}{python}
ft=lambda t : t*exp(-t)
fp=lambda p : 1/(p+1)**2
t=np.logspace(-1,3,256)
f_gaver_stehfest=np.array([gaver_stehfest(tk,fp,20) for tk in t])
f_analytic=np.array([ft(tk) for tk in t])
\end{minted}
Nous traçons ci-dessous la différence relative entre ces deux fonctions.

\section{Algorithme fixe de Talbot}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
On souhaite se donner la relation (18) de~\cite{abate2004} 
qui se présente sous la forme :
\[
f(t) = \dfrac{r}{M} 
\left\{ 
    \dfrac{1}{2} F(r) e^{rt}+ \sum_{k=1}^{M-1} 
    \textrm{Re}\left[ e^{ts(\theta_k)} F(s(\theta_k)) (1+i\sigma(\theta_k))\right]
\right\}
\]
avec $\theta_k=\frac{k\pi}{M}$, et les relations (19), (16) et (11) de [3] 
sont nécessaires pour implémenter la méthode à savoir 
$r=\frac{2M}{5t}$,$\sigma(\theta)=\theta+(\theta\cot\theta-1)\cot\theta$,
$s(\theta)=r\theta(\cot\theta+i)$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Nous cherchons à nouveau à reproduire la transformée de Laplace inverse :
\[
    te^{-t}=\laplacei{\dfrac{1}{(p+1)^2}}
\]
La différence relative entre l'algorithme fixe de Talbot et le résultat exact 
est donnée ci-dessous

Nous utiliserons les relations exactes obtenues au chapitre~\cref{chap-model}
