\section{Contexte}

Il existe une forme analytique de la transformée inverse basée sur                                                            
la formule de Mellin-Fourier\cite{Ostertag}:                                                                                  
$$                                                                                                                            
s(t)=\laplacei{S(p)}=\int_{c-j\infty}^{c+j\infty} e^{pt}S(p)\dd{p}
