\chaptermark{Unités du Système International}
La Conférence générale des poids et mesures (CGPM) qui se réunit tous les 
quatre ans depuis 1889, est un organe décisionnel chargé de prendre les 
décisions en matière de métrologie et en particulier en ce qui concerne le 
Système international d'unités (SI)\footnote{La conférence se réunit dans les 
locaux du Bureau international des poids et mesures (BIPM), au Pavillon de 
Breteuil, à Sèvres (France).}.

Ces conférences ont établi les différentes unités fondamentales à partir 
desquelles un grand nombre de grandeurs peuvent être dérivées. Dans cette 
annexe, nous présentons ces unités fondamentales ainsi que les grandeurs 
dérivées utiles à la mécanique.

Le Système International compte sept unités de base quantifiant des grandeurs 
physiques indépendantes.
