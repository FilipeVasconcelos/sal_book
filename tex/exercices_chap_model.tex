\exercice{Analyse de la réponse temporelle d'un SLCI~\moyen}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Nous avons relevé la réponse à un échelon unitaire, 
déclenchée à $t=0$, d'un système linéaire.
Cette réponse est donnée par la figure ci-dessous.
L'objectif de cet exercice est de caractériser le système 
à partir de cette réponse temporelle.

Nous rappelons que le temps du premier maximum est 
donné par $t_1=\dfrac{\pi}{\omega_d}=\dfrac{\pi}{\omega_0\sqrt{1-\xi^2}}$
et le dépassement par $D=e^{\dfrac{-\xi\pi}{\sqrt{1-\xi^2}}}$
On pourra s'aider des abaques 1 et 2 présentés en annexe.
