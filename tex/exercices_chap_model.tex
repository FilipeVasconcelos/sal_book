\exercice{Analyse de la réponse temporelle d'un SLCI~\moyen}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Nous avons relevé la reponse à un échelon unitaire, 
declenchée à $t=0$, d'un système linéaire.
Cette réponse est donnée sur la figure~\ref{fig-2nd} ci-dessous.
L'objectif de cet exercice est de caractériser le système 
à partir de cette réponse temporelle.

\question{Déterminer :}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\begin{itemize}
    \item l'ordre du système,
    \item le gain statique $K$,
    \item le temps de réponse à 5\%,
    \item et le dépassement relatif en \%.
\end{itemize}

\question{En déduire l'amortissement $\xi$, la pulsation propre $\omega_0$ et 
écrire la fonction de transfert.}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Nous rappelons que le temps du premier maximum est 
donné par $t_1=\dfrac{\pi}{\omega_d}=\dfrac{\pi}{\omega_0\sqrt{1-\xi^2}}$
et le dépassement par $D=e^{\dfrac{-\xi\pi}{\sqrt{1-\xi^2}}}$
On pourra s'aider des abaques 1 et 2 présentés en annexe.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
On souhaite déterminer les fonctions de transfert donnant lieu à réponse 
indicielle ayant certaines caractéristiques.
