\exercice{Analyse de la réponse temporelle d'un SLCI~\moyen}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Nous avons relevé la reponse à un échelon unitaire, 
declenchée à $t=0$, d'un système linéaire.
Cette réponse est donnée par la figure ci-dessous.
L'objectif de cet exercice est de caractériser le système 
à partir de cette réponse temporelle.

\begin{itemize}
    \item l'ordre du système,
    \item le gain statique $K$,

\question{En déduire l'amortissement $\xi$, la pulsation propre $\omega_0$ et 
écrire la fonction de transfert.}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Nous rappelons que le temps du premier maximum est 
donné par $t_1=\dfrac{\pi}{\omega_d}=\dfrac{\pi}{\omega_0\sqrt{1-\xi^2}}$
et le dépassement par $D=e^{\dfrac{-\xi\pi}{\sqrt{1-\xi^2}}}$
On pourra s'aider des abaques 1 et 2 présentés en annexe.

\exercice{Modélisation de la chute libre~\moyen}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
On cherche à déterminer l'expression de la vitesse d'un corps en chute libre 
dans l'air. 
Lorsqu'on lâche, sans vitesse initiale, ce corps $M$ (hypothèse du corps 
ponctuel) de masse $m$
dans cet environnement, il est soumis à deux forces :
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\begin{itemize}
    \item son poids $m\vect{g}$
    \item $-k\vect{v}$ qui s'oppose au mouvement et qui 
        est proportionnelle à la vitesse, $k$ dépend généralement 
        de la forme du corps et de la composition de l'atmosphère
