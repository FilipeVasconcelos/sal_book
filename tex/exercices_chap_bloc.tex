On cherche à déterminer la relation entre la sortie $S$ et les deux entrées 
$E$ et $P$ du schéma-bloc suivants :

Pour celà nous allons appliquer la propriété de linéarité des \textsc{SLCI}. 
C'est à dire que nous allons déterminer les fonctions de transfert en prenant 
en compte respectivement chaque entrée en considérant l'autre nulle.
La sortie globale du système sera alors la somme des sorties indépendantes. \\

La tension $v_1(t)$ est imposée en entrée et on mesure la tension de sortie 
$v_2(t)$ aux bornes de la résistance $R_2$.
En appliquant les lois de Kirchoff, on obtient les relations suivantes 
entre les tensions et les courants:
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\begin{align*}
    v_{R_1}(t)+v_2(t)-v_1(t)&=0\\
    i_1(t)-i_2(t)-i_3(t)&=0
\end{align*}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
où  $v_{R_1}(t)$ est la tension aux bornes de la résistance $R_1$.

Aux bornes des dipoles, nous avons également :
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\begin{align*}
    v_{R_1}(t)&=R_1i_1(t)\\
    v_{C}(t)&=\dfrac{1}{C}\int_0^t i_2(\tau) \dd{\tau}=v_2(t)\\
    v_2(t)&=R_2i_3(t)
\end{align*}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
En remplaçant celles-ci dans les relations de Kirchoff, on obtient les 
équations régissant ce modèle électrique:
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\begin{align*}
    i_1(t)&=\dfrac{1}{R_1}\big(v_1(t)-v_2(t)\big)\\
    i_2(t)&=i_1(t)-\dfrac{1}{R_2}v_2(t)\\
    v_2(t)&=\dfrac{1}{C}\int_0^t i_2(\tau) \dd{\tau}
\end{align*}
