On cherche à déterminer la relation entre la sortie $S$ et les deux entrées 
$E$ et $P$ du schéma-bloc suivants :
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\begin{center}
    \tikzsetnextfilename{ex1-chap_bloc-ext}
    \input{tikz/ex1-chap_bloc.tex}
\end{center}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pour celà nous allons appliquer la propriété de linéarité des \textsc{SLCI}. 
C'est à dire que nous allons déterminer les fonctions de transfert en prenant 
en compte respectivement chaque entrée en considérant l'autre nulle.
La sortie globale du système sera alors la somme des sorties indépendantes. \\
