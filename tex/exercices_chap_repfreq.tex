\exercice{Représentation graphique d'un signal harmonique~\facile}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Soit un système linéaire du premier ordre régit par la fonction de 
transfert $H(p)$ telle que :
\[
H(p)=\dfrac{1}{1+2p}
\]
On considère la réponse harmonique à un signal d'entrée $e(t)=E_0\sin{\omega t}$
d'amplitude $E_0$ et de pulsation $\omega$.

On rappel (c.f annexe) que la réponse harmonique en régime permanent
à une telle sollicitation est de la forme :
\[
s(t)=E_0|H(\jw)|\sin{(\omega t+\phi)}\label{eq-rh}
\]
où $|H(\jw)|$ et $\phi(\omega)$ sont respectivement le module et 
l'argument du nombre complexe $H(\jw)$.

\question{Déterminer le gain naturel $G(\omega)=|H(\jw)|$ et la 
phase $\phi(\omega)$ à partir de la fonction de transfert.}
